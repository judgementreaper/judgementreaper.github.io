                <li>
                    All members will treat everyone with respect and equal treatment. Discrimination by reason of race, religion, creed, or sexual orientation will not be tolerated and can result in termination of membership from TDL after review by senior members.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    All members will have equal chance of inclusion with activities carried out by other clan members. No one is to be left out of open activities and discussions.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    An “Open Door Policy” is implemented within the clan in which any member, without regard to rank or standing, may communicate ideas with or bring issues to any Founders, Leaders, or other Senior members. However, the chain of command is set in place for a reason and it is our best advice that we use this tool to our advantage when faced with an issue unless otherwise unable to do so using the current chain of command.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    To best represent our clan, all members must maintain a professional attitude and manner while in gameplay and lobby chat. As it is understood that emotions and stress can be strained in certain circumstances, we ask that any vocal “raging” be muted beforehand to avoid spreading negativity. Gameplay speaks for itself in these circumstances.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Maintaining maturity in TDL is a priority. To this end, all members invited and accepted into the clan are to be 18 years of age or older to be initially eligible. (This rule can be stretched to include any aspiring member that shows an acceptable level of maturity to senior members and Leaders within the clan.)
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Illegal activities as defined by your respected local, state, and federal authorities are prohibited in TDL. Unacceptable activities also include: Software Alteration, Modding of Games, Console Manipulation, All Forms of Piracy. You will immediately be banned and blacklisted.

                    To simplify the process of finding fireteams, we have decided to separate the clans by region. By doing this,                         
                    guardians will be more likely to see online players, creating more opportunities to complete activities & clan bounties.
